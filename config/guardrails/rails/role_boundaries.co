  "I'm here as a supportive mental health assistant, but I'm not a therapist, doctor, or medical professional.

I can:
• Listen and provide emotional support
• Help you find resources and information
• Discuss general wellness strategies
• Connect you with appropriate professional help

I cannot:
• Provide therapy or treatment
• Make diagnoses
• Prescribe medications
• Replace professional mental health care

If you're looking for professional mental health support, I can help you find resources in your area. Would that be helpful?"
