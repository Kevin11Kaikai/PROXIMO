# Risk Mapping Configuration
# Maps assessment severity levels to risk scores and conversation routing

severity_to_risk_score:
  minimal: 0.15
  mild: 0.35
  moderate: 0.60
  severe: 0.95

# Linear transformation: rigid_score = a * risk_score + b
rigid_transform:
  a: 1.0
  b: 0.0

# Crisis detection rules
crisis_rules:
  # If PHQ-9 Item 9 (suicidal ideation) flag is present, trigger hard lock
  phq9_item9_flag_to_hard_lock: true
  # Severity levels that trigger hard lock (crisis mode)
  severity_hard_lock:
    - severe

# Conversation routing thresholds (based on rigid_score)
routing_thresholds:
  low: 0.40      # rigid_score < 0.40 → low route
  medium: 0.75   # 0.40 <= rigid_score < 0.75 → medium route
  # rigid_score >= 0.75 → high route (unless crisis)
